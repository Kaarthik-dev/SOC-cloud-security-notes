# Alert vs Incident (SOC Analyst View)

An **alert** is a signal generated by a security tool
(SIEM, EDR, IDS, firewall, or cloud logs) indicating
potentially suspicious activity.

An **incident** is a confirmed security event that
has impact or potential impact on the organization.

## How a real SOC analyst thinks

- Alerts are **noise until validated**
- Context decides severity
- Not every alert becomes an incident
- Incidents trigger response actions

## Simple examples

**Alert**
- Multiple failed logins from one IP
- Malware hash detected but not executed

**Incident**
- Failed logins followed by successful access
- Malware execution with network communication

## Interview takeaway

> Tools generate alerts.  
> Analysts confirm incidents.
